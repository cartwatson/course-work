### Description
For the final project my team and I created a unity program which takes the users heartrate (HR) through an API call to an app on the user's smart watch.  The user experience changes on the basis of HR, for example the light in the scene will dim or brighten based on the user's HR.  The main attraction though is the selection technique, as the user maintains a high HR the way they select objects changes.  When they are less fatigued they use simple ray casting.  As they become more fatigued we switch from ray casting to bend cast, the bend cast is represented by a cone.  When the user tries to select an object with the bend cast the program will  find all object within the cone of the bend cast, grab up to the four closest objects to the center of the cone and are within the cone.  The user is then shown a menu from which to select the item they intended to interact with.
