# Test data 

*   The `data/` directory holds data files consumed by your program.  Here we have provided `msg*.txt` files that contain DuckieCode for you to decrypt
*   The `test/` directory contains text files that can allow you to test your decrypter on specific DuckieCode characters, such as
    *   individual special character groups
    *   all special characters
    *   lower case characters
    *   upper case characters
*   In addition to these files, you'll find the `cryptMe*.txt` files, which are input files for `demo/duckieEncrypter.py`
