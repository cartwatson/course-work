**This is a well-made diagram. It is cool how your diagram is mostly symmetrical. It is extremely easy to read and see what you were thinking. Having that will make everything much less confusing when you are working with all the different classes. Also having the diagram so clean will make it easy for others to understand your code.

I do not understand why NumberSet is instantiated by Card. My thinking was to have Deck or UI instantiate it. This way all the cards in the deck will pull from the same range and the game will be playable.

As per the part 0 criteria found in the instructions directory of the project we need to “design new classes, methods, and data members to satisfy the customer’s requirements…”. I do not know if you have thought up of any new classes that you want to add, but as you do I think it would be a good idea to add it into the UML diagram.  Doing so helps you know how the new addition will affect the project, and specifically where it will do so.

Your diagram is good, so I am having trouble finding improvements. This is super small and only aesthetic, but I do not think there should be two separate lines/arrows for the instantiating flows.  I could be wrong though. Another couple of minor things is that the text is quite small and some class names are italicized, and others are not.

PEP 8, the global standard for Python requires methods and regular variables to be written in snake case but yours is in camel case. You might want to investigate that.

Overall this is a great diagram, you did a great job!

**Overall great UML diagram! It was very organized and easy to read, and I thought the structure of it flowed really well. Also, great job adding descriptions next to the arrows in the diagram, it helps to understand how each class goes together. The only thing I would add to that is just a little description from the class Menu to MenuOption to better understand their relation, just so all of your arrows connecting classes have a description.

I know this is something that Brad did that I liked, but maybe think about having a different class for both the main menu and the deck menu in order to make implementation easier. I thought it was a good idea that I might add to my code, and it’s just a suggestion. If you do decide to do something like that though, make sure you add additional tests under the test file so your program still passes all the tests provided, and so you can double check that any additional classes / methods work too.

Also thank you for including void next to each of the void methods in your diagram, that’s something that I’ve seen people leave out and I think adding it helps better understand the use of each method.

Sorry I don’t have a whole lot of pointers, but I think your diagram shows a really good understanding of the program as a whole. I’m interested to see your final product, and I think  you are off to a great start. Good luck!
