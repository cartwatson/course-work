**Your UML diagram is great.  One of the best two I’ve seen.  Your organization seems great, it will make it very easy to implement your code having this all laid out from the start.  The diagram itself is very easy to read and understand is well built.

Your classes all look great.  I would suggest adding classes that were not included in the starter code, but I wasn’t able to see any gaps or places where we would need more methods or classes. However, another ‘intern’ I did a UML peer review implemented inheritance in classes he created for the menu.  I found this to be a really smart idea and would recommend you test it out if you feel comfortable with inheritance.

In terms of methods, yours look great. I can’t see any issue that you would have using just those methods.  You may find it useful to create getter and setter methods for testing private class variables for the purpose of testing, but those do not need to be included in this diagram as they would not be necessary to the functionality of the program.

My other concern about your UML diagram is what the difference, if any, is between a class that generates another class and a class that creates another class.  Although that’s just semantics at this point, but when your diagram is this good from the start it’s hard to pick out anything else to criticize.

Overall your UML looks great! Good luck with your project!**
