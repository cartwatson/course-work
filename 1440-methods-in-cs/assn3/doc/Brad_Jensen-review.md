**Your UML diagram is fantastic. The best I've seen for sure.  Your organization is great, and the diagram is very well laid out and easy to read.
Your classes seem more than sufficient to complete the requirements of this project.  The addition of Main Menu and Deck Menu are a great idea that I never would have thought of using.  Inheritance is a very efficient way of creating them as well.
I did however notice that you don’t have your constructors listed on the diagram.  That might be something to add or make a note of just to make sure they’re adequately planned out.  It’s certainly not wrong but I wondered why you changed the methods of the classes to all lower with underscores separating the words instead of using lower camel case. My only other concern about your UML diagram is what the difference, if any, is between a class that generates another class and a class that creates another class.  Although that’s just semantics at this point, but when your diagram is this good from the start it’s hard to pick out anything else to criticize.
Overall, I think your diagram is great, it includes all the classes and methods provided while adding a few helpers to simplify and compartmentalize the code a bit more.  I think this will make implementing your plan a lot easier to have the menu classes separated out like that. This looks like a great plan, I hope implementation goes well for you!**
