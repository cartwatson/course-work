<!-- TODO - In order
    [X] fix code from last assignment to read from file
    [] uses perspective projection
        needs to pass the uProjection matrix in to simple.vert
    [] Render any two models from the standford 3d scanning repo
        [] You'll need to modify the server.js file to add one more MIME type: '.ply': 'text/plain'
    [] Write code to parse data from .ply files
        no usage of existing libraries
    [] Per vertex, diffuse lighting
    [] shading computations are done in vertex shader
    [] 3 lights
        [] each should turn on and off
        [] each should be a different color
        [] each should be in a different location
        [] diffuse lighting only
    [] interesting animation
