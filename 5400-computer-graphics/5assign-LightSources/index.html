<!-- TODO
    [] Render any two models from the standford 3d scanning repo
    [] Write code to parse data from .ply files
        no usage of existing libraries
    [] Per vertex, diffuse lighting
    [] shading computations are done in vertex shader
    [] 3 lights
        [] each should turn on and off
        [] each should be a different color
        [] each should be in a different location
        [] diffuse lighting only
    [] uses perspective projection
    [] interesting animation
