Requirement Specs
    draw a chessboard from user defined overall width and height using user defined starting point.
    if width or height are not given default value is 250.
System Analysis
    there no formulas used.  Data comes in from the user for startX, startY, with width and height
    being optional inputs.
System Design
    Necessary inputs come from user and are used to call the chessboard function.
    The main() function calls drawChessboard from the chessboard file.
    The chessboard file uses the inputs to draw the outside of the chessboard.
    The drawChessboard function then calls the drawMini function.
    The drawMini function uses inputs to draw the squares of the chessboard.
