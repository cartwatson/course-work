Requirement Specifications
    Go back to the drawing the chessboard assignment. Turn the program into an Object-Oriented program. Use the starter
    file assn13-task1.py. This is where your program starts, and it cannot be modified. Create a chessboard.py file that
    creates a Chessboard class. It should follow the pattern of the chessboard assignment. However, drawing will be
    occur with the call of draw(), as indicated in assn13-task1.py.
System Analysis
    the class Account() is imported from account.py to assn12-task2.py
    data comes in from the user and is used to create the class, navigate the menu,
    or mutate sections of the object previously defined.
    No formula complicated enough to note.

            no height input
            width 400
            visually check results
        Test Case 3
            coords -100, 300
            no height or width input
