<title>Software Development Plan</title>
<h1>Requirements Specification</h1>
    <!--A detailed written description of the problem this program aims to solve.
    Describe what a good solution looks like.
    List what you already know how to do.
    Point out any challenges that you can foresee. -->
    <P>Program needs to not contain html, bar this file.  All HTML elements should be produced by JavaScript</P>
    <P>Program needs to take two numeric inputs, one color input, and one select input</P>
    <P>Program should process these inputs when Compute button is pressed</P>
    <P>New Divs should be added to the page when the compute button is pressed, they should be added in order from top to bottom</P>
    <P>Program should produce an error div when an operand is not selected</P>

<h1>System Analysis</h1>
    <!-- List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
    Explain what form the output will take.
    Describe what algorithms and formulae will be used (but don’t write them yet). -->
    <P>Program needs to take two numeric inputs, one color input, and one select input</P>
    <P>Program should process these inputs when Compute button is pressed</P>
    <P>New Divs should be added to the page when the compute button is pressed, they should be added in order from top to bottom</P>
    <P>Program should produce an error div when an operand is not selected</P>
    <P>no algorithms or formulae needed (bar basic alrithmatic)</P>

<h1>Design</h1>
    <!-- Function signatures that include:
    Descriptive names.
    Parameter lists.
    Documentation strings that explain the purpose, inputs and outputs.
    Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    Write a few specific examples that occurred to you. -->
    <P>result(var operandOne, var operandTwo, var op, var color)</P>
    <P>the first three inputs are printed out but are also used to determine the result of the equation</P>
    <P>Color is used to determine color of the div</P>
    <P>If operandOne or OperandoTwo is "" the function outputs and error message to the user</P>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
    <!-- (More or less) working Python code. -->
    <P></P>

<h1>Testing & Documentation</h1>
    <!-- A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
    Include a description of what happened for each test case.
    For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
    Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience. -->
    <P>Tested error cases</P>
    <P>Tested adding new divs after deleting most recent div</P>
    <P>Tested adding new divs after deleting all divs</P>
    <P>Tested all operands</P>
    <P>Tested decimals and negative numbers for operands</P>

<h1>Deployment</h1>
    <!-- Your repository pushed to GitLab. -->
    <P></P>

<h1>Maintenance</h1>
    <!-- Write brief and honest answers to these questions: (Note: do this before you complete Phase 5: Deployment)
    What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
    Are there parts of your program which you aren’t quite sure how/why they work?
    If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
    Will your documentation make sense to
    anybody besides yourself?
    yourself in six month’s time?
    How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
    Will your program continue to work after upgrading
    your computer’s hardware?
    the operating system?
    to the next version of Python? -->
    <P>This is my first JS project and likely is written naively and sloppily, I'm sure there are more efficient ways for writing the code I did.</P>
    <P>I understand how my program works thoroughly.</P>
    <P>My code is fairly simplistic, it would not take long to find a bug should one be found.</P>
    <P>This documentation should be complete enough to make sense to anyone that reads it.</P>
    <P>It would be easy to extend this code in the future.</P>
    <P>Vanilla JS should be supported by everything for a long time, and should work on all hardware.</P>
