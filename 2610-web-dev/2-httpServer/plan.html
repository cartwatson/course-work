        <h1>Software Development Plan</h1>
        <div style="background-color: lightgray">
            <h2>Requirements Specification</h2>
            <!--A detailed written description of the problem this program aims to solve.
            Describe what a good solution looks like.
            List what you already know how to do.
            Point out any challenges that you can foresee. -->
            <P>This program will include the files from the previous static blog assignment</P>
            <p>This program will also now feature a webserver written in python using the class "http.server — HTTP servers"</p>
            <P>This server will direct to the previously mentioned blog pages, it will also handle the following errors: 404, 403, 418, and 301</P>
            <P>This server will only respond to HTTP GET requests</P>
            <P>This server will use 301 redirects in a variety of ways to make it easy to navigate for the end user; filename extensions can be ignored, filenames can be mispelled (to a degree)
                filenames can be similar in meaning (again, to a degree), some files will not use their filename, etc</P>
            <p>The server will provide a favicon if the browser requests it</p>
            <P>The server will have a debugging page that is generated at runtime</P>
            <P>The server will handle error 418, teapot</P>
            <P>The server will handle error 403, forbidden</P>

            <h2>System Analysis</h2>
            <!-- List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
            Explain what form the output will take.
            Describe what algorithms and formulae will be used (but don’t write them yet). -->
            <P>All data for the program should come from the files provided from assign1 and the webserver</P>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <!-- Function signatures that include:
            Descriptive names.
            Parameter lists.
            Documentation strings that explain the purpose, inputs and outputs.
            Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
            Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
            Write a few specific examples that occurred to you. -->
            <h5>CS2610Assn2.py will contain the following methods: dataHelper, do_GET</h5>
            <h4>dataHelper(self, requestHandler, type_location, fileName, code)</h4>
            <P>It will take in data and handle the writing to the server</P>
            <P>requestHandler will be a CS2610Assn2 obj</P>
            <P>code is the error/success code that is included in the HTTP header</P>
            <p>type_location will be the location if the code is 301 Moved Permanently</p>
            <P>type_location will be the type if the code is not 301 Moved Permanently</P>
            <p>filename will be a file name if code is 200 OK, otherwise it is unused</p>
            <h4>do_get(self)</h4>
            <p>do_get overrides the default function from BaseHTTPRequestHandler</p>
            <p>it returns nothing and has no parameters besides self</p>
            <P>it will handle GET requests</P>
            <h4>Good and bad input</h4>
            <p>if the user tries to go to a file that doesn't exist the program will give an error 404 page not found</p>
            <p>if the user tries to go to the forbidden page it will give an error 403 forbidden</p>
            <p>if the user tries to go to the teapot page it will give an error 418 teapot</p>
            <p>all good input should be handled</p>

            For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.

            <!-- Write brief and honest answers to these questions: (Note: do this before you complete Phase 5: Deployment)
            What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
            Are there parts of your program which you aren’t quite sure how/why they work?
            If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
            Will your documentation make sense to
            anybody besides yourself?
            yourself in six month’s time?
            How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
            Will your program continue to work after upgrading
            your computer’s hardware?
            the operating system?
            to the next version of Python? -->
            <P>The method dataHelper could be cleaned up to not user the same variable for two purposes</P>
            <P>The documentation should be complete and file should be readable without comments but some are included for readability</P>
            <p>This server should work on at minimum python versions >=3.10</p>
