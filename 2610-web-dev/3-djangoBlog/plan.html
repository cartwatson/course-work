<title>Software Development Plan</title>
<h1>Requirements Specification</h1>
    <!--A detailed written description of the problem this program aims to solve.
    Describe what a good solution looks like.
    List what you already know how to do.
    Point out any challenges that you can foresee. -->
    <P>Templates must include a dynamic element</P>
    <p>Not required to support /teapot, /forbidden, /debugging, or /bio* -> /about.html</p>
    <p>Create two models with at least the following fields</p>
    <P>Blog Class: title - CharField, author - CharField, content - TextField, posted - DateTimeField</P>
    <P>Comments Class: blog - CharField, commenter - CharField, email - EmailField, content - TextField, posted - DateTimeField</P>
    <P>Create the following dynamic pages:</P>
    <p>Blog Home: a list view which displays the 3 most recent blogs, newest first.</p>
    <p>Blog archive: a list view which lists all blogs, newest first.</p>
    <p>Blog entry, a detail view which displays: An entire blog post, all comments for that blog displayed from newest to oldest, an “Add Comment” form which posts a new comment and redirects the user to back to the same Blog entry</p>
    <P>Create a data migration to populate the database with dummy blogs and comments.</P>
    <P>Migration must do the following: </P>
    <P>Create at least 4 blog entries so that graders can easily verify that the Blog home and Blog archive pages operate correctly.  The content in the blogs doesn't matter to me so long as they contain more than 100 words so that we may verify that you trimmed them down on the blog home and archive pages.</P>
    <P>Each blog entry has an arbitrary title, author and posted date.</P>
    <P>Each blog's content is arbitrary; they can all be identical.</P>
    <P>Create at least 4 comments with the following requirements: </P>
    <P>Create an arbitrary email address, commenter name and posted date and fill each comment with arbitrary text; they can all be identical.</P>

<h1>System Analysis</h1>
    <!-- List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
    Explain what form the output will take.
    Describe what algorithms and formulae will be used (but don’t write them yet). -->
    <P>Data will come from the database</P>
    <P>Data will be generated in the migration</P>
    <P>Data will be used all around as it is dynamic so everything will get passed around a lot</P>

<h1>Design</h1>
    <!-- Function signatures that include:
    Descriptive names.
    Parameter lists.
    Documentation strings that explain the purpose, inputs and outputs.
    Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    Write a few specific examples that occurred to you. -->
    <P>Templates need to be created for all the dynamic pages</P>
    <p>Static files need to have their own location</p>
    <P>Models for blog and comment need to be created with appropriate fields as mentioned earlier.</P>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
    <!-- (More or less) working Python code. -->
    <P>Working python/django/html/css</P>

<h1>Testing & Documentation</h1>
    <!-- A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
    Include a description of what happened for each test case.
    For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
    Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience. -->
    <P>Check that every page works</P>
    <P>Try to go to a page that doesn't exist to verify error 404 catching</P>
    <P>Click every link on every page</P>

<h1>Deployment</h1>
    <!-- Your repository pushed to GitLab. -->
    <P>Repo is pushed to personal github https://github.com/cartwatson/2410-WebDev/tree/main/3-djangoBlog (May be private repo)</P>

<h1>Maintenance</h1>
    <!-- Write brief and honest answers to these questions: (Note: do this before you complete Phase 5: Deployment)
    What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
    Are there parts of your program which you aren’t quite sure how/why they work?
    If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
    Will your documentation make sense to
    anybody besides yourself?
    yourself in six month’s time?
    How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
    Will your program continue to work after upgrading
    your computer’s hardware?
    the operating system?
    to the next version of Python? -->
    <P>Code could use more comments throughout for clarity</P>
    <P>Some areas of code sacrifice readablity for conciseness</P>
    <P>Now that I understand more of what I'm doing I am positive that there is a cleaner way of organizing my code</P>
