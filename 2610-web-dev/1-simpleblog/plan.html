        <h1>Software Development Plan</h1>
        <div style="background-color: lightgray">
            <h2>Requirements Specification</h2>
            <!--A detailed written description of the problem this program aims to solve.
            Describe what a good solution looks like.
            List what you already know how to do.
            Point out any challenges that you can foresee. -->
            <P>This program will be a static blog, it will have four pages: index, about, techtips-css, and techtips+css.  
                It will feature a variety of features of html and css to demo and to increase my familiarity with them.  
                I already know a good amount of html and css from work so I don't anticipate too much of a challenge although 
                I am sure I will inevitably get caught on a bug at some point.  But I think it should be relatively smooth sailing.</P>

        <div style="background-color: lightblue">
            <h2>System Analysis</h2>
            <!-- List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
            Explain what form the output will take.
            Describe what algorithms and formulae will be used (but don’t write them yet). -->
            <P>The program will primarily be text and links all of which will be contained in the html/css. However 
                it will use at least three locally stored images in the about page.  The output will be web pages.
                There will not be any algorithms or formulae used.</P>
        </div>
        <div style="background-color: lightcoral">
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <!-- Function signatures that include:
            Descriptive names.
            Parameter lists.
            Documentation strings that explain the purpose, inputs and outputs.
            Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
            Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
            Write a few specific examples that occurred to you. -->
            <P>There is no use for functions in this program.</P>

        <div style="background-color: lightcyan">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <!-- (More or less) working Python code. -->
            <P>HTML and CSS code</P>
        </div>
        <div style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow">
            <h2>Testing & Documentation</h2>
            <!-- A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
            Include a description of what happened for each test case.
            For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
            Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience. -->
            <P>Testing for this project is very simple.  All links need to be clicked to ensure proper navigation within the site and to external resources.</P>
            <p>All links are working.</p>
            <p>No bugs discovered</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background-color: lightgreen">
            <h2>Deployment</h2>
            <!-- Your repository pushed to GitLab. -->
            <P>Repo is pushed to personal gitlab https://github.com/cartwatson/2410-WebDev/tree/main/1-simpleblog (May be private repo)</P>

            <h2>Maintenance</h2>
            <!-- Write brief and honest answers to these questions: (Note: do this before you complete Phase 5: Deployment)
            What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
            Are there parts of your program which you aren’t quite sure how/why they work?
            If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
            Will your documentation make sense to
            anybody besides yourself?
            yourself in six month’s time?
            How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
            Will your program continue to work after upgrading
            your computer’s hardware?
            the operating system?
            to the next version of Python? -->
            <P>the html code in techtips files could likely be written in a more efficient way</P>
            <P>the navblock at the top needs to be changed in four files for continuity</P>
            <P>there is the possibility that my documentation/comments won't be readable due to a variety of factors but primarily my relative newness to html and css</P>
            <P>the program should run fine on any hardware/os combo that can render html</P>
