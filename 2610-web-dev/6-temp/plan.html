<title>Software Development Plan</title>
<h1>Requirements Specification</h1>
    <!--A detailed written description of the problem this program aims to solve.
    Describe what a good solution looks like.
    List what you already know how to do.
    Point out any challenges that you can foresee. -->
    <P>Program must make a call to the IP API to find the user's latitude and longitude</P>
    <P>Program must make a call to the weather API, using the user's latitude and longitude</P>
    <P>Call should return current conditions</P>
    <P>Results should come back in imperial units</P>
    <P>While results are pending, loading indictor is displayed, removed when results are returned</P>
    <P>Make a call to the weather API for the 5-day 3-hour forecast</P>
    <P>All results displayed in their own divs</P>
    <P>Divs are color coded to "defualt", "likely", and "unlikely"</P>
    <P>Display a count for the number of each of the likelyhoods</P>

<h1>System Analysis</h1>
    <!-- List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
    Explain what form the output will take.
    Describe what algorithms and formulae will be used (but don’t write them yet). -->
    <P>Vue needs to get the user's IP address</P>
    <P>The IP address is used to get the users latitude and longitude from FreeGeoIP</P>
    <P>The latitude and longitude are provided to OpenWeatherApp to get current weather conditions</P>
    <P>The latitude and longitude are provided to OpenWeatherApp to get 5-day 3-hour forecast</P>
    <P>VueJS handles all of that information and displays it to the user through manipulating the DOM</P>

<h1>Design</h1>
    <!-- Function signatures that include:
    Descriptive names.
    Parameter lists.
    Documentation strings that explain the purpose, inputs and outputs.
    Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    Write a few specific examples that occurred to you. -->
    <P></P>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
    <!-- (More or less) working Python code. -->
    <P></P>

<h1>Testing & Documentation</h1>
    <!-- A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
    Include a description of what happened for each test case.
    For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
    Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience. -->
    <P></P>

<h1>Deployment</h1>
    <!-- Your repository pushed to GitLab. -->
    <P>Zipped and put on canvas</P>

<h1>Maintenance</h1>
    <!-- Write brief and honest answers to these questions: (Note: do this before you complete Phase 5: Deployment)
    What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
    Are there parts of your program which you aren’t quite sure how/why they work?
    If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
    Will your documentation make sense to
    anybody besides yourself?
    yourself in six month’s time?
    How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
    Will your program continue to work after upgrading
    your computer’s hardware?
    the operating system?
    to the next version of Python? -->
    <P></P>
