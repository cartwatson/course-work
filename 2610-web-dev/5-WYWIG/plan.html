<title>Software Development Plan</title>
<h1>Requirements Specification</h1>
    <!--A detailed written description of the problem this program aims to solve.
    Describe what a good solution looks like.
    List what you already know how to do.
    Point out any challenges that you can foresee. -->
    <P>The program will provide the user with a UI that allows them to input their weight (as a number) and the unit of their weight, press a convert button, and see how much their weight is worth in the current price of gold</P>
    <P>The program will provide this UI through a single page application</P>
    <P>The unitconversion will take place in the django app, all hardcoded values are in a migration</P>
    <P>The price of gold comes from querying the NASDAQ through their API</P>
    <P>Challenges will include; breaking down the HTTP response for unit conv, and querying NASDAQ.  The rest has already been implemented in other projects and should be familiar</P>

<h1>System Analysis</h1>
    <!-- List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
    Explain what form the output will take.
    Describe what algorithms and formulae will be used (but don’t write them yet). -->
    <P>Nasdaq querying, input is json output is a single global js variable</P>
    <P>DB querying, input is a http requet output is JSON</P>
    <P>input out weight and unit from user, output of div, inserted into the DOM from JS</P>

<h1>Design</h1>
    <!-- Function signatures that include:
    Descriptive names.
    Parameter lists.
    Documentation strings that explain the purpose, inputs and outputs.
    Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    Write a few specific examples that occurred to you. -->
    <P>The only functions will be the AddDiv called when the user converts and fetch requests made for nasdaq</P>
    <P>The AddDiv is very simple, it takes a little bit of information about the div, the weight and unit and adds a new div to the page via the DOM.</P>
    <P>AddDiv will make a request for unitconv in order to correctly calculate the information for the div</P>
    <P>The fetch request is made async</P>
    <P>It takes the url </P>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
    <!-- (More or less) working Python code. -->
    <P></P>

<h1>Testing & Documentation</h1>
    <!-- A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
    Include a description of what happened for each test case.
    For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
    Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience. -->
    <P>User puts in no weight</P>
    <P>User puts in no unit (inspect element and delete)</P>
    <P>User trys to query nasdaq without connection</P>
    <P>User puts in a negative weight</P>

<h1>Deployment</h1>
    <!-- Your repository pushed to GitLab. -->
    <P>Submitted to canvas</P>

<h1>Maintenance</h1>
    <!-- Write brief and honest answers to these questions: (Note: do this before you complete Phase 5: Deployment)
    What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
    Are there parts of your program which you aren’t quite sure how/why they work?
    If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
    Will your documentation make sense to
    anybody besides yourself?
    yourself in six month’s time?
    How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
    Will your program continue to work after upgrading
    your computer’s hardware?
    the operating system?
    to the next version of Python? -->
    <P>This is my first time interfacing a lot of things so I know that I haven't done it in the most efficient or readable way</P>
    <P>As such this code may struggle to be maintained</P>
    <P>This code relys on the user having django installed</P>
    <P>It also requires my private key to NASDAQ</P>
    <P>This should work across python3 and django 4? I believe it's django 4</P>
    <P>This should work on any operating system with the above installations of python and django</P>
    <P>It uses vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS so there shouldn't be any issues there</P>
    <P>Should work across any hardware that is still functioning and connected to wifi (for NASDAQ querying)</P>
