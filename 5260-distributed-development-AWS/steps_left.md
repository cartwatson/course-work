## Step 4 – Create and Test a RESTful API

- Using any mechanism of your choice, create a RESTful API that will be the front-end for your widget-request-handler Lambda function.
- Then, test the API in the AWS API Gateway Console using the appropriate HTTP methods and even bodies. Your testing of the API should try method requests that submit create, update, and delete requests.
- Take three or more screen snapshots that illustrate your API processing create, update, and delete requests.

## Step 5 – Deploy your API and Additional Testing

- In this step, deploy your API to a production, labeled "prod" stage and test using a generic HTTP client, like Postman.
- Take three or more screen snapshots that illustrate your API processing create, update, and delete requests.
