Requirement Specifications
	Create a program that uses Turtle to draw shapes. Show the following menu:
	Enter Circle
	Enter Rectangle
	Remove Shape
	Draw Shapes
	Exit

	Circles			User inputs position, radius, and color. The position is the CENTER of the circle
	Rectangles		User inputs position, height, width, color. The position is the lower left-hand corner
	Colors			Allow red, yellow, blue, and green only
	Remove			Show the number of items in the list and let the user enter a number and remove that
					shape from the list. You may assume that they only enter a number within the range that
					you display.
	Draw Shapes		Draw the shapes in the order they are in the list. Clear the screen if shapes had been
					drawn before. The color is the fill color of the shape. Shapes are only drawn after this
					selection, not after entering or removing a shape.
	Guidelines
		Create a class called Circle in its own file called circle.py
		Create a class called Rectangle in its own file called rectangle.py
		In each class create a method called draw() that will draw the shape
		Store all Circle and Rectangle objects in a single list
		Use a loop to draw all of the shapes
		Create a file called assn14-task3.py that contains a main() function to run your program
System Analysis
    the class circle is imported from circle.py to assn14-task3.py
	the class rectangle is imported from rectangle.py to assn14-task3.py
	the module turtle is imported into circle.py
	the module turtle is imported into rectangle.py
    data comes in from the user and is used to create the class, navigate the menu, or submenu.
    No formulas.
